### Why I Like Developing?

Hello World!!
When I was studing socal science, I naturally interested in the world.
After reading books and looking around, I realized that information technologies are very important for our human being lifes.
This world is changing so fast. when I was young maybe middle school, the mobile phone had only two options: calling and texting.
Now the Electronic Cars are another mobile information devices. 
However,

That's why I'm developing it.

Thank you.
